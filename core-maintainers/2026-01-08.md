## Agenda

- **RFDs**
  - [ACP Agent Registry](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/289) (@ignatov)
    - https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry
    - Can we reuse this format for Zed extensions?
      - Either translate to them, or use registry as another way to load them
      - Ideally Zed would just use the registry
    - Better update lifecycle
      - Do we pin to a version?
      - Either cron job to update to new versions
      - Or submodule process
    - Should we keep only the pointer to the latest?
      - Should we keep track of history of all versions?
    - Tied to auth updates so it is smoother to login to all of these agents
    - Would be nice to have some basic way to track downloads
      - Have some website/backend that people hit so we can add some custom logic
    - For launch it should be somewhere on the main domain/seperate domain, but more official
  - [Authentication flow for agents](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/330/files) (@anna239)
    - Agent managed: push button, agent manages it itself
    - terminal auth: \_meta property, promote it
      - restricted to the agent binary, don't allow the command somehow
      - only allow additional args to the normal acp mode
    - ability for the user to provide a key
      - Does it require a restart or not?
      - Not possible at the moment to know if the env is supposed to be there
      - Allow the client to know if this is even supplied, if not, it can restart the process with that variable and automatically call the auth method for the user
      - Agent still only uses this env variable when the auth method is called
    - Will be better to keep this (as it currently is) within the protocol and not the registry to allow for more flexibility
    - Would be nice to support alternate providers outside config files, maybe not related to auth flow
    - Allow for types and client / agent can filter based on capabilities
    - MCP Elicitation flows useful especially for remote agents
  - [Symposium](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/359) (@nikomatsakis)
    - Provide extensions to agents that are more powerful than just an MCP server using the proxy mechanisms
    - In the long run, parts of this would be better housed within a specific language org, but parts of it are the glue that allows for these sorts of extensions
    - Provides capabilities for both adding deterministic and non-deterministic flows that don't always have to go through the agent like MCP, "superset of MCP", more portable and work in any editor
    - Skills will likely replace many MCP servers. ACP Extensions could do this that works well across agents
      - Ideally user just decides what they want the agent to do better, doesn't matter if they are skills, mcp servers, etc
  - VSCode extension (@nikomatsakis)
  - [Session Config Options](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/session-config-options) - Prepping for Preview (@benbrandt)
- Naming of ACP
  - Lots of SEO competition, or confusion with the other ACPs
  - Need to gather pros/cons and structure/framework before meeting so we can have a productive meeting
  - Even using full-name and non acronym is a choice

## Action items

- [ ] Prep a productive naming discussion
- [ ] [@benbrandt] Zed plan for registry
