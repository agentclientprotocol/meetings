## Agenda

- **RFDs**
  - [ACP Agent Registry](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/289) (@ignatov)
    - Release Zed and JetBrains support next Wednesday
    - sort out mintlify config tomorrow + CDN
  - [Session Config Options](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/session-config-options) (@benbrandt)
    - In Preview, would promote to Completed unless people have objections or changes needed?
  - [session/list](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/session-list) (@benbrandt)
    - Move session/list, session/resume and session_info_update notification to Preview
    - Implemented in Zed + codex-acp. JetBrains has session_info_update + session/resume, session/list needs some more testing
    - Needs another look with the remote situation in mind
    - Would be nice to take a session history from one agent to another. Would need to be able to start a session with existing history
      - Different than forking within the same agent process, would be nice even for local to remote claude code
  - New prompt lifecycle design to handle queueing messages is becoming more important
    - Write RFD and talk especially with the agent teams
- We need a better way to communicate with all agent developers of updates to the protocol
  - Need a mailing list or something similar

## Action items

- [ ] Ben: fix claude-code-acp auth flow
- [ ] Sergey: take a look at the list/load/resume session flows with remote scenario in mind
- [ ] Ben: look into options for mailing list/communication method
