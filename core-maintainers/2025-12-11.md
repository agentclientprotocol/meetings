# Core Maintainers Meeting - 2025-12-11

## Attendees

## Agenda

- **RFDs**
  - [Proxy Chains](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/243) (@nikomatsakis)
    - Working prototype being refined for proxy middleware functionality
    - Enables two key features:
      - Initialize as proxy with message forwarding to client/agent predecessors/successors. Able to compose components together, so you can affect your ACP setup without implementing an entire agent or client
        - Extending something like "claude skills" across multiple agents
      - "ACP" MCP transport
    - Ready for draft merge pending final tweaks, asked for vibe check from the team
      - no major concerns raised
    - Demo planned for end of week
  - [ACP Agent Registry](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/289) (@ignatov)
    - Move from links on GitHub to downloading agents from Registry
    - Zed could move to support downloading agents from the registry
    - could also tie-in to proxy components, host in additional to agents themselves
    - Another goal is to allow people to use a custom registry that works with a common spec
      - basically just a json file with a specific format
      - would be nice to have this ~Q2 2026
  - Authentication flow for agents [auth](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/330/files) (@anna239)
    - currently, most agents don't supply auth methods
    - in general, can we provide agents with the ability to present a gui or request data from the user?
    - for JetBrains it would be nice to have a separate flow for authentication
      - different UX flow needed
      - need to be careful to avoid phishing issues, especially once we're downloading agents from the registry
      - Most agents right now are supporting api keys, allow to reuse key from the keychain
  - Next Edit Suggestion [NES](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/325), @ignatov
    - Current RFD isn't where we'd want it for an API, but it at least provides an anchor for discussion
    - less of a common workflow across edit prediction providers, especially around how they handle context gathering
      - some are just a model, you send them a prompt they provide a diff
      - others have an API with specific fields they want
      - Agus: tradeoff of value protocol brings vs constraints it imposes
      - can we get an idea from the providers on what they would expect from an API?
- Update about the governance, @ignatov, @benbrandt

## Action items

- [ ] [@all] everyone take a look at the auth RFD and give comments
- [ ] [@ignatov] will gather feedback from providers, @jetbrains + @zed EP teams will give input too
